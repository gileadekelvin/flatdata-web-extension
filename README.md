# Flatdata Viewer web extension (unofficial test)

### A web extension for Chrome which adds a icon on github for opening the file on FlatData Viewer.

<br>

[Flatdata](https://octo.github.com/projects/flat-data) is a project developed by github developers looking to automate data transformation processes. One of the tools available is the Flatdata Viewer, which is an interface designed to visualize data files (.csv, .json) in a more intuitive way and with greater power. 

This extension is aiming to add a button on the page of a file in github to redirect the user to the Flatdata Viewer to explore the file with all the power they have.

You don't need to type the repository on Flatdata form, just click the button and enjoy!

The button is added next to the delete icon.
